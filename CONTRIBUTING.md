We use GitHub issues to track bugs and errors. If you run into an issue with the project:

- Open an [Issue](http://github.com/gladiaio/gladia/issues/new).

- Describe the *reproduction steps* that someone else can follow to recreate the issue on their own.

A good way to know if your issue is well discribed is to ask yourself "using the provided informations and only the provided informations, am I able to reproduce the behaviour and know why there is a bug?". If the answer is no, that mean you need to be more precise regarding how to reproduce the behaviour and what to expect.
 
Once it's filed a team member will try to reproduce the issue with your provided steps and add it to our backlog until one of our member is able to take care of it or a community member want to fix it.
